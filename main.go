  BasicDNS. This is a simple hobby/toy DNS server which is super heavily inspired by:
    - https://routley.io/tech/2017/12/28/hand-writing-dns-messages.html
    - https://github.com/dlorch/dnsserver   Brilliantly simple example of DNS lookup, but more importantly a good binary
      encoding and UDP example.
